Hi All,


Two data files for Project 1 are ready to use.

1. ATNT50.zip and ATNT50_DataFormat.txt

2. ANTN200.zip and ATNT200_DataFormat.txt

The Linear Regression Algorithm code in MATLAB are also available: MATLABLinRegression.m

You can use ANY computer programming Language. We prefer Matlab.


You need to do:

1. KNN 

2. Centroid

3. Linear Regression

The correct class labels for the test data are not provided. Your task is to compute them correctly.
