Hi All,


Two data files for Project 1 are ready to use.

1. ATNT50.zip and ATNT50_DataFormat.txt

2. ANTN200.zip and ATNT200_DataFormat.txt

The Linear Regression Algorithm code in MATLAB are also available: MATLABLinRegression.m

You can use ANY computer programming Language. We prefer Matlab.


You need to do:

1. KNN 

2. Centroid

3. Linear Regression

The correct class labels for the test data are not provided. Your task is to compute them correctly.

Hi All,

The data are uploaded to blackboard.
A detailed accountment is there too.
You should start to do the project.

Projects are done by teams (one or two person a team).
You need to write your own codes, both
the data organization and 
the classifier algorithm (kNN and Centroid mothods).  

For Linear Regression, you can use downloaded codes.
But it is only 3 lines of codes in practice.

As explained in the DataFormat.txt files,
most of your time will be on arranging the data into the 
format that the classifier requires as input.

You MUSTï½—rite your OWN codes (except those we clearly allowed).

We will do Project presentation on Wed, Feb 24. Each team has
5 mins to present your result.
